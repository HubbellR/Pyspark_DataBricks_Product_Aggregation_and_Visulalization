This project is uses pyspark within databricks to perform a plethora of necessary data aggregations and visualizations using pyspark within the DataBricks interface.


This Project imports data into Databricks, where it is then analyzed and aggregated into a series of predefined questions. These questions and their solutions are best outlined in the Pyspark_Sales_Analysis 2024-04-21 12 30 12(3).py file, which sumarized the pyspark script created in the DataBricks environment.
